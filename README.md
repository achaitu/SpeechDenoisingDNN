# Speech Enhancement usingDeep Neural Networks
## Introduction
Whenever we work with real time speech signals, we need to keep in mind about various types of noises that gets added and hence resulting in corruption of noise.
Therefore, in order to make a better sense of the signals, it is very much necessary to enhance the speech signals by removing the noises present in them. 

## Applications:
* Automatic speech recognition
* Speaker recognition
* Mobile communication
* Hearing aids 

## DNN based architectures
* Autoencoder Decoder 
* Recurrent Neural Nets
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines
